{\bf What benefits/problems come from deploying services in serverless functions?}

Benefits:
\begin{itemize*}
  \item {\bf Improve develop efficiency:} Serverless computing does not mean developers work without any server. It instead allows them not to focus on issues related to server-based architectures. Therefore, developers can pay more attention to the logic for processing client requests, which can improve efficiency of software development. 
  \item {\bf Decrease develop cost:} Past IDC and modern cloud architecture, which normally uses a monthly charging mode, can result in the situation that they still charge even if no current users or no applications are deployed. Contrastingly, serverless architecture often uses a Pay-as-you-go mode, which allows developers only pay infrastructure provider for resources they actually used, and not pay for idle capacity. For example, with AWS\footnote{https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/} developers pay only for the individual services, for as long as using periods, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing, which have a potential savings range from 99.8\% to 99.95\%.
