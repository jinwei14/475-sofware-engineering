200~Micro-services: 
Micro-services - also known as the micro-service architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are. The idea is to split the application into a set of smaller interconnected smaller services that has it own business logic, some micro-services will expose their REST, RPC or other API provided by other services. It has a lots of advantage compare to the monolith. In Monolithic architecture, it has limited complexity and limitation, it is slow compare to the micro-servers, also difficult to scale. However, in micro-service, all of the services has their own database. These factor ensure the high maintainablity and testability. Micro-services enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications
